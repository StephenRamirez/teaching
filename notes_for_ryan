this is our place where i will teach ryan how to make iphone apps

@interface <--- this alllows you to declare a class 

ex:  @interface Test : NSObject 

if you noticed the NSObject this is the super class 
this means the Test class inherits the methods and instance variables from the NSObject class and can use them

next chapter

you are able to store variables in an object and heres how you do it

ex: @interface Test : NSObject {

int x;
int y;

}

this means that a number variable x and y are stored within the Test class

now lets say you want to preform a function from the Test class 
well you would need to define it first so lets make one!

ex: @interface Test : NSObject {

int x;
int y;

}

-(void)print;

in the header file where this interface function is placed you to not say what the funciton does but simply initiliaze that it is there and that the 
class can see it and use it
